                    People flip cars for profit because it offers a tangible opportunity to earn money by buying
                    vehicles at a low price,
                    often through auctions or private sales, and reselling them at a higher price after repairs or
                    upgrades.
                    Car enthusiasts and those with mechanical skills are particularly drawn to this practice, as it
                    allows them to combine their passion
                    for automobiles with the potential for financial gain. The relatively low entry barriers and
                    flexibility of car
                    flipping—whether as a full-time business or a side hustle—make it an appealing option for many.
                    Success in this field relies
                    on market knowledge and careful management of risks, including legal issues and unexpected repair
                    costs, but the rewards can
                    be substantial for those who navigate these challenges effectively.
